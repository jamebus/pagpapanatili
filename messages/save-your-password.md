# Consider saving your password

Your password has been saved. You won't need it again to use your backups. You
may wish to store your password elsewhere in case your saved password becomes
unavailable. This can happen during drive failures or when installing to a fresh
machine.

Losing your password means that your backups are **irrecoverably lost**. It is
recommended to save your password to your password manager or similar secure
storage.

Would you like to view your password so you can save it?
