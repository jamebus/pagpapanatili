# Configure your password

Your *password* is used to encrypt and decrypt your backups. You won't need to
remember it. While it's best to auto-generate one, you can also enter one if
needed. This is especially useful if you are using an existing repository.

You can auto-generate a password now or enter one. The default size is good, you
can choose a different size if you have special requirements.
