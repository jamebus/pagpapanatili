# Authenticate with your storage bucket

Credentials used to connect to your bucket are stored in *profiles*. A new
profile will be created now.

Enter your profile name. The default name is usually OK. You may want to choose
a different name if you wish to use multiple buckets or regions, and want to
easily differentiate them.
