# Configure your repository

Your *repository* is where your backups are stored. Where is your repository?
Enter its URL and region.

It is possible to have multiple repositories per bucket. For example, it's
helpful to have separate repositories for your personal, educational, and
business machines. If this is a use case for you, consider using a descriptive
prefix in your repository URL.
